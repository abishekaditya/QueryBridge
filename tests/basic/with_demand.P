% XSB Datalog generated from GraphQL query with root fields: project
% With demand transformation

% Demand transformation facts and rules
% Seed demand with bound arguments for project
demand_project_B("GraphQL").

% Magic predicate for project
m_project_B(ROOT) :- demand_project_B("GraphQL").
% Propagate demand to tagline fields
demand_tagline__(PROJECT_1) :- m_tagline_ext(PROJECT_1).
% Magic predicate for tagline
m_tagline__(PROJECT_1) :- demand_tagline__(PROJECT_1).
% Propagate demand from project to its fields

% Query field rules

% Rules for field: project
project_result(ROOT) :- m_project_B(ROOT), project_ext(ROOT), NAME = "GraphQL".
project_tagline_result(PROJECT_1, TAGLINE_2) :- tagline_ext(PROJECT_1, TAGLINE_2).

% Final answer predicate combining all query results
ans(project_tagline) :- project_ext(PROJECT_1), project_result(ROOT), project_tagline_result(PROJECT_1, project_tagline), project_tagline_result(PROJECT_1, TAGLINE_2).
